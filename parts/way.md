#The way to self-determination
"Grandpa", Puri spoke to me as we sat in the evening in the food circle, "Can you please tell us a story from back then? That was really exciting. Mauro, asked me to ask you what you did to be free again."  
  
"Yeah, get the other kids and let's sit around the campfire", I tell Puri.  
  
"What have you done so that you can grow your own food today, where did you get the land from?", the boy from Guatemala asks.   
  
"Phew, that's a long story", I replied.  
  
"Yes, please tell us, Grandpa", stammered Puri.  
  
"Well, let's see how far we are coming. So then there were still borders. These are some kind of fences built around a country like Portugal for example. On the other side of the border was Spain. Guatemala also had such borders. At that time all people in Portugal were spaking Portuguese, while Spanish was spoken in Spain. This was a very similar language but it used other words for the same items. Spanish was also spoken in Guatemala. But in addition, 42 other languages and dialects were spoken in Guatemala, making it difficult to communicate with each other. We used to speak German in Germany and English in England. English is spoken all over the world these days. Only the indigenous people still speak the local language."   
  
"Every country had a government. There were people who ruled over the respective country... they have determined what we are allowed to do and what not. We had to give the government money at that time so that they would settle everything for us. Many of us did not agree that they had to hand over half of their hard-earned money to the government because they believe the government did not spend the money on what was right. Of course, a few things made sense, at least as long as you still believed in the system. But many people no longer believed in this system because they felt exploited. And rightly so, compared to today. Today, we no longer have to give money to a government. We have no governments at all and we no longer have borders. It eventually became superfluous."   
  
"Now I'll tell you how we did it.", I grinned. 
  
"Well, start now", Puri stammered quite impatiently, probably knowing what is coming. 
  
"We had such a code in Germany, that was called the Basic Law. A few years after the reunification of east and west Germany, we have made this a constitutional one, but only one article has been changed so that from now on laws can only be passed by referendum. "
  
"As a result of this small adjustment, we as humans regained control of all decisions in the country. First of all, we have eliminated unnecessary laws that have only been created to help big companies so that they can make more money. Then we successfully voted on a basic income. So that every person in Germany, whether poor or rich, whether black or white, got enough money every month to pay rent, food, drink, etc. With that, people could finally say NO, I do not work for this company anymore. As a result, the armaments industry was shut down first, because no one wanted to build more weapons because they were only used to kill other people and animals. " 
  
"Great, great, GREAT", cheered the kiddies.
  
"Grandpa, that was a great story", Puri said enthusiastically.  
  
"Wait, it goes on.", I suggest.  
  
"We voted for a law that forbids us from killing living things. This means no more wars, no more killing animals and no mass animal husbandry anymore. Now there was no meat to eat, but people got used to it very quickly. That had the consequence that a whole industry died. Even in medicine fewer and fewer doctors were needed because hardly anyone got sick. No one has any more stress, or let's say, the bosses could no longer fumble around the employees because they would otherwise have just laid the work."  
  
"That sounds great, I get goose bumps when you tell about it.", says Jo. 

I had not noticed that she had joined us.    
  
"Children, can you imagine what else has changed after we humans again had the scepter in our hands?", asks Jo.
  
"What happened to the land that belonged to the others?", asks a boy.  
  
"The landowners were expropriated and each person was given a plot on which he could then grow food. Also, the companies were expropriated, who owned residential buildings. One could only own a single apartment, companies were no longer allowed to own apartments, the other apartments were given to the homeless, refugees and people who wanted to live there. Rents have been completely abolished. Nobody had to pay rent. If one wanted to build a small house on his land, this was also allowed. At that time there were already these Tiny Houses. The law was changed so that these little houses could now have a foundation instead of a chassis. So you could build your own house yourself.", says Jo.
  
"Can you imagine what it means when such a thing has been successfully implemented in a country?", I ask. 
  
"Yes", said one of the children, "The other countries want that too." 
  
"Exactly", said Jo, "nearly all European countries, except for Switzerland, had a basic income within 5 years. In the US and South America, it was eventually introduced. In the end, even Switzerland had this income."    
  
"Can you imagine what also has changed?", asks Jo. 
  
"Hm, people had fun working again?", asks one of the children.
"Yes, exactly", I replied, "everyone now did only what he enjoyed the most. We did not call it work anymore. Some have discovered the way to art. Others have taken time to help people find meaning in their lives."  
  
"Your grandfather, is one of those people who was helped", joked Jo, "I gave him a lot of affection and showed him his place in life."  
  
"Yes, Granny means the place next to her.", I joke, "Kidding ... your grandma showed me what my gifts are. Every person has some gifts and talents. Once he or she has found it then life flows. And Granny, so has her shamanic methods to sift through these gifts", I tell.  
  
"Even work such as the removal of garbage or the cleaning of apartments and shops has made people fun again, because this work was paid very well, otherwise no one else would have done it. You also did not have to work 8 hours a day and certainly not 5 days a week because you actually had enough money to live on. Through the work one has earned something additional to live in prosperity."  
  
"But if nobody worked anymore, where did all the stuff come from, like toys and food and TV", one of the guys wants to know.  
  
"Well, for one thing, 80% of the work was already done by machines and on the other hand there were not so many people who did any advertising. Some unnecessary things were not produced anymore, because nobody needed them anyway. And so it settled in slowly, that there was only productive work. Bureaucracy was slowly reduced. For example, there were no more employment offices and then the tax office slowly made no sense, because we abolished the income tax and only had the VAT to tax the machines."   
  
"Did you make any wild parties back then, after which everything was so great?", one of the girls wants to know.
  
"We traditionally had a huge party every Sunday in the Mauerpark in Berlin and people from the other cities did the same. Yes", Jo replied.
  
"But, when did you completely abolish the money?", one of the fathers of the kids would like to know. He had joined us because he wanted to pick up his two little ones.
  
"The money ... yes ... that was a lengthy process.", I mention.
  
By saying, "We built Camp Eden back then and there we only used money to buy tools, salt, and some other important things we could not make ourselves. But then I will tell about it tomorrow. It's getting late and we want to do some music and dance. Talk to me about the topic again tomorrow. ", I finish the round.

Did you like my vision of the Camp Eden and would you like to live like this someday?   
  
With the help of this book, I'm looking for like-minded people with whom I manifest our common vision or with whom I can just talk about this topic. We do not have to wait until we all get a basic income, the money gets abolished and we get land provided, because there are still too many people sticking to their current lives with money and industrial products. I do not want to wait that long.
Already we can implement this. I have just found a property in Portugal. 3.000 m2 near the sea. There grow some fruits and nuts such as walnuts, apples, pears, figs, cherries, oranges and much more. The fruit can no longer be sold because it is too small for the European standard. Although you can not build a house there, yurts, tepees and tiny houses are supposedly allowed.
The plot of land can be purchased for 16.000,- € plus fees.  
  
Also in Denmark near my favorite kitesurfing spot there are cheap recreational plots. 5.000 m2 for about 24.000,- € and there it has apple trees.
For a community of 80 people, these properties are quite small, they are only meant to serve as an example to show what is possible. Then I know someone from a crystalland (Rainbow) in Colombia. They have 6 hectares of land there in the Andes. There costs one hectare about $ 800. I do not know exactly in what currency, but I assume US dollars.
The farther away from Babylon (that's what we call the rest of the world that still has capitalism), the cheaper the plot of land becomes. 
  
Once you have found the right plot, then you could firstly pool your savings with other people with whom you would like to start the project and acquire the land in cash.  
On the other hand one could possibly take up a mortgage for the plot.  
If you do not find a bank that gives you the money, I personally do not think it's really bad, because you do not depend on a bank, because you still have the opportunity to do crowd funding.
For example, donors could be offered to lend a helping hand while setting up the camp, or they may spend some time rehearsing there. Or you give them some of the harvest, or or or...  
  
The proceeds of this book will for the most part flow into this type of project. I would like to create a prototype of such a community.  
If you are interested in joining in or participating or if you would like to contact me, do not be afraid to send me an email.
